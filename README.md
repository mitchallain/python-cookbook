# Python Cookbook

Organized examples and notes on Python language features and some of my
preferred patterns.

## Project Organization

All examples are organized into the following subtopics:

- configuration
- logging
- plugins
- profiling
- ros
- threads

Simple, self-contained, and runnable example scripts follow the format
`example_<description>.py`. Snippets which are not easily demonstrated are
provided in small Markdown files in the form `<description>.md`.
